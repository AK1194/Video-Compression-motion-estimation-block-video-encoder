# Video-Compression-motion-estimation-block-video-encoder
This project is about the motion estimation block of a video encoder in video compression. The aim of this project is to find an optimum motion estimation algorithm which has a fair trade off between accuracy of frame estimation and the speed. 
I have implemented Full Search algorithm (FS), logarithmic search algorithm (LS) in MATLAB using 10 frames of Foreman.

The sample video (10frames) is also uploaded here in the zip file.
